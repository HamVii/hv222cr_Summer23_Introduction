Hello. My name is Hampus. I'm 30 years old and I'm from the city of Norrköping. Currently I work as a **physiotherapist** which is the result of three years at **Linköpings Universitet**. 

*Obviously* my earlier studies have not really done it for me and now I'm here - ready to expand my knowledge about all things ***computer sciences***.

Having a deep rooted interest in computers and tech this 180-turn in direction of possible livelihood is probably not *that* weird. What excites me about tech is the incredibly fast development as well as a work space with a lot of problem solving (that doesn't solely rely on me listening to people's often heavy lifestories whilst navigating a scientific field that's quite frustrating). I've always had an itch for learning and the upcoming years will hopefully stratch that itch. 

`I've already learnt some new things such as;`
1. Repos! Why they should have a place in my life.
2. Terminals! What they are and why we need to become friends.

I've learnt many other important things during my time on earth like;
- How to throw together some quite decent cocktails (balance is the key, like with the Force!).
- That Viggo Mortensen *actually* broke his toe when he [kicked that Uruk-hai helmet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcCnD_MvM9I).

To wrap this up I'm ready to get stuck into programming with the words of Bob Ross as my guide.

Thanks for now.
